This is Austin Nathaniel Fife's Thesis presented for a MSC
at the University of Idaho in 2018.

This folder contains the files outputs from the 'Psyllid_Analysis.R' script
most files are named explicitly, the unabbreviated files have been tided
from the script outputs and are easier to read if you want to get a quick idea
of what observations look like. If you want to check each part of the model,
the abbreviated files are created from running the scripts and are the logs
and outputs of models from the analysis.

bhvr_data is a combined list of all
recorded psyllid settling behavior, used in the analysis, bhvr is a copy of
the same data after removing one psyllid I considered an outlier. fcnd_data
is a combined list of oviposition data, fcnd is the same with the outliers
removed. Files preceded with 'd' refer to duration data, files preceded with
'i' refer to incidence data. There are ANOVAs (_anov), Compact Letter Displays
(_CLDs), model parameters (_model) model summaries (_summary) and 
untransformed data values (_dat) for each analysis. hatch had two models
run, hatch_1 included interactions, hatch_2 did not include interaction terms.
