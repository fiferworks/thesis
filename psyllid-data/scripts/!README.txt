This is Austin Nathaniel Fife's Thesis presented for a MSC
at the University of Idaho in 2018.

These files are commands issued to R in order to recreate my analysis.
They are in numerical order, I recommend you run them that way because many
of them depend on the previous coding segement. Unnumbered scripts were not
used in the analysis per se, but contain ancillary information considered
when organizing the data. 'egg_hatch_totals.R' was excised from the final
script, 'power_calculations' was done before designing the experiment
to predict effect sizes, 'other_graphs' is a series of failed/rejected (but
still useful) exploratory data visualizations not used in the final product.
Sometimes it is better to run these scripts seperately in order rather than
the main script in the 'Psyllid_Data' folder if you are having errors in
some of the text file outputs in 'results'.
