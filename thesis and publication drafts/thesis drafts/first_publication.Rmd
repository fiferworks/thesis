**Abstract**
The potato/tomato psyllid *Bactericera cockerelli* (Šulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae)
transmits "*Candidatus* Liberibacter solanacearum" (Lso), the causal agent of
Zebra chip disease (ZC) in potato. ZC creates large economic losses when disease
incidence is high. No commercial potato variety has been found resistant
to the pathogen or the disease symptoms. 
We observed host acceptance behaviors using no-choice assays on breeding clones
derived from *Solanum chacoense* Bitter with putative resistance to Lso and/or ZC.
We also compared oviposition and egg fertility for psyllids held
on these genotypes. Probing frequency and female walking duration were
highest on Russet Burbank, suggesting greater activity on Russet Burbank
than on the three resistant genotypes. The number of eggs did not
differ among genotypes but declined on all genotypes during the last
period of observation (18-20 days after confinement with a male). Egg
fertility did not differ among genotypes for the first three observation
periods (16-18 days after confinement with a male) but more eggs were fertile on Russet
Burbank than 10LB or 3LB during the last observation period (18-20 days
after confinement with a male). We discuss the modality of resistance in context of these genotypes.

Introduction {#ch:intro}
============

The potato/tomato psyllid, *Bactericera cockerelli* (Šulc) (Hemiptera:
Triozidae), is a small sternorrhynchan insect pest of solanaceous crops
such as potato, tomato, cape gooseberry, tobacco, pepper, eggplant and
tamarillo [@Aguilar2013; @Martin2008; @Knowlton1934; @Liefting2008; -@Liefting2009; @Wallis1955].

First discovered in Colorado [@Sulc1909], potato psyllids have a history
closely tied to potato growing regions and potato diseases
[@Richards1973]. *B. cockerelli*'s geographical distribution ranges from
southern Canada to Central America, throughout the western United States
[@Butler2012a; @Munyaneza2007a; @Rehman2010] and
a recent introduction to New Zealand [@Liefting2009;
@Martin2008; @Teulon2009].

Publications regarding the psyllid initially emerged from 1926-1928, due
a condition affecting solanaceous plants known as 'psyllid yellows'
[@Eyer1933; @Richards1928; @Richards1973].

Potato psyllids have recently been identified as vectors of
"*Candidatus* Liberibacter solanacearum" (Lso) (Rhizobiaceae:
Alphaproteobacteria) [@Cicero2016; Goolsby et al. -@Goolsby2007a;
@Liefting2009; @Munyaneza2007a].
Lso is an uncultured gram-negative $\alpha$-proteobacterium [@Liefting2009]
that infects solanaceous plants. Lso is transmitted to the plant's phloem by the
psyllid's saliva while feeding [@Cooper2014].

Symptoms in potato include stunting, swollen axillary buds, aerial
tubers, leaf purpling, chlorosis and reduced yield 
[@Munyaneza2007a; -@Munyaneza2008]. Infection also alters tuber
sugars and phenolics; resulting in brown stripes which char and blacken
when fried [@Alvarado2012; @Buchman2012;
@Navarre2009]. This condition is known as 'zebra chip' disease (ZC)
[@Crosslin2011; @Hansen2008; @Liefting2009; @Lin2009]. Zebra chip-affected tubers are
unmarketable, which results in large economic losses for growers
[@Munyaneza2007a; @Rosson2006]. Yield reduction
from Lso infection has ranged from 43% to 93% in some cases 
[@Munyaneza2008; -@Munyaneza2011].

Lso and ZC symptoms were first described in 1994 in Mexico
[@Secor2004; @Munyaneza2009] and was detected in
the United States in 2000 [@Secor2004]. Lso and ZC were first detected
in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon
in 2011 [@Murphy2012; @Crosslin2012]. Since 2011,
Lso and ZC continue to threaten potato production in the
PNW, increasing production costs for growers
[@Greenway2014; @Greenway2018; @Guenthner2012; @Wenninger2017].

Traditional management of the potato psyllid vector relies on multiple applications of pesticides
[@Echegaray2017; @Greenway2014; @Guenthner2012]. In 2018, around half of Eastern Idaho
growers' insecticide expenditures were related to ZC control
[@Greenway2018]. Chemicals such as abamectin, imidacloprid, spiromesifen,
thiamethoxam and dinotefuran [@Gharalari2009; @Goolsby2007b; @Guenthner2012;
@Vega-Gutierrez2008] are commonly used but, some psyllid populations are starting to develop resistance to common neonicotinoids and abamectin [@Hernandez-Bautista2013; @Chavez2015; @Liu2004; @Prager2013].

The difficulty and large expense of psyllid control
emphasizes the need for alternative and improved pest management
strategies such as host plant resistance.

Host plant resistance is a valuable part of integrated pest management
[@Butler2012a a; @Diaz-Montano2013; @Kogan1988; @Munyaneza2012b b]. Even a small
amount of resistance/tolerance of a plant to a vector or it's pathogen
can reduce damage below action thresholds and reduce pesticide
applications [@Kennedy1987]. Host plant resistance increases
pesticide efficiency and helps to delay insecticide resistance
[@Gharalari2009]. Currently no commercial potato varieties have been
found with acceptable resistance to Lso. [@Anderson2012; @Munyaneza2011].

Potatoes which have been bred with closely related plants such as
*Solanum chacoense* Bitter [@Rashidi2017] and *Solanum berthaultii* Hawkes
[@Butler2011] have shown less Lso infection and/or ZC
symptoms than other genotypes tested. By determining how these genotypes
resist/tolerate Lso or to the psyllid vector [@Butler2011; @Putten2001; @Kennedy1987],
we can decide which traits should be bred or cloned into commercial cultivars to create resistant potatoes [@Casteel2006; -@Casteel2007; @Kaloshian2004]. 

We examined psyllid host acceptance behaviors and oviposition on three potato breeding clones derived from *Solanum chacoense*: 'A07781-10LB' ('10LB'), 'A07781-3LB', ('3LB') and 'A07781-4LB' ('4LB') [@Rashidi2017].
These genotypes exhibit high tolerance and low susceptibility to Lso [@Rashidi2017], possibly due to resistance/tolerance to the psyllid vector. Our results will help clarify potato-psyllid interactions on these genotypes, which will help plant breeders to develop Lso-resistant potatoes [@Kennedy1987].\


Materials and Methods {#ch:mms}
=====================

Plant Characteristics and Living Conditions {#sec:plants}
-------------------------------------------

Potato clones were provided by the USDA-ARS, Small Grains and Potato
Germplasm Research Unit Aberdeen, ID, USA. We used three sibling clones
derived from *Solanum chacoense* Bitter with putative tolerance/resistance to Lso:
A07781-3LB, A07781-4LB, and A07781-10LB [@Rashidi2017]. 'Russet Burbank'
was used because it is susceptible to Lso [@Munyaneza2011] and because of its large impact on potato production
in the Pacific Northwest [@NASSNorthwestRegionalFieldOffice2017]. The
selected potatoes were grown in a greenhouse maintained between 25-32°C,
32% RH, with a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D). Plants were grown in pots of
approximately 8.5 cm length $\times$ 8.5 cm width $\times$ 9.5 cm
height, with a soil mixed in ratios of 4:4:4:1 peat moss: compost:
coconut coir: perlite. Fertilizer was not used on experimental plants to
avoid nitrogen increases which may alter insect feeding behaviors
[@Pfeiffer1983; -@Pfeiffer1984]. We used plants in their vegetative
growth stage (growth stage II) [@Dwelle2003].

Insect Characteristics and Living Conditions {#sec:insects}
--------------------------------------------

A Lso-positive potato psyllid colony was reared in the same greenhouse
conditions as described above to avoid phenological asynchrony
[@Hodkinson2015]. Psyllids were allowed free access to both Russet
Burbank potatoes and 'Yellow Pear' tomatoes (*Solanum lycopersicum* L.).
Colony plants were fertilized once weekly with approximately 17 g of
24:8:16 NPK fertilizer per gallon of water (MiracleGro All Purpose Plant
Food, Scotts Company, Marysville, OH). Plants were replaced as needed.

Lso Detection {#sec:pcr}
-------------

Idaho harbors four haplotypes of the potato psyllid: Northwestern,
Western, Central and Southwestern and two haplotypes of Lso: Lso A and
Lso B [@Dahan2017; @Wenninger2017]. Our lab colony
was determined to be comprised of 'Central' psyllids infected with Lso
'B' via the methods described in Swisher and Crosslin
[-@Swisher2014a a]. A sample of forty psyllids taken from the colony
were transferred to individual microcentrifuge tubes filled with 70%
ethanol. Lso incidence was tested at the Aberdeen Research and Extension
Center (Aberdeen, ID, USA). DNA extraction was based on the methods
described by Marzachi et al. [-@Marzachi1998]. Individual psyllids
were ground by a homogenizer (Omni International Inc., Kennesaw, GA),
macerating each psyllid for 1 minute at high speed and an additional
minute at medium speed in 500 of Cetyl Trimethylammonium Bromide 2%
(Alpha Teknova, Inc., Hollister, CA, Cat. No. C2190) (Composition: 2%
CTAB, 100mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.4M Sodium Chloride
(NaCl). Microcentrifuge tubes were then incubated at 60 for 30 minutes
and gently mixed by inversion every 10 minutes while incubating. Tubes
were then spun in a centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes and then the
supernatant was transferred to clean 2 ml tubes. The supernatant was
vortexed for approximately 20 seconds with 500 ml of chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:1 v:v) (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Atlanta, GA: Catalogue number
C0549), then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5-10 minutes at 4. The clean
supernatant was transferred to a new tube, then refrigerated isopropanol
(Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Atlanta, GA: Catalogue number I9516) was added at
a rate of 2/3 of the volume of the supernatant. The mixture was then
refrigerated at -20 for 20-30 minutes. DNA was precipitated by
centrifuging the mixture for 20 minutes at 14,000 rpm at 4, gently
pouring off the supernatant and keeping the precipitated DNA pellet. The
pellet was washed in 300 of 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 5 mins at
10,000 rpm. The pellet was then dried overnight in a fume hood. Once
dry, 30 of nuclease-free water was added. DNA was stored at -20.

Extracted DNA samples were then processed using a Sybgreen method.
SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad, Hercules, CA) was
mixed in a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad, Hercules,
CA). HLBr (5'-GCG TTA TCC CGT AGA AAA AGG TAG-3') and LsoF (5'-GTC GAG
CGC TTA TTT TTA ATA GGA-3') were used as primers [@Li2006;
-@Li2009] and 10 of Sybgreen supermix was added to 150 nM of each
primer with 1 of DNA template. The program cycle was as follows: one
cycle at 98 for 2 mins followed by 40 cycles of 95 for 10 sec and 62 for
20 sec. The melt curve was 65 to 95, with increments of 0.5 sec^-1^. DNA
of a healthy tuber was used as a negative control. DNA of a Lso-infected
tuber was used as a positive control and water was used as a no-template
control in all tests. pIDTSmart Kan (Synthetic Genomics, SGI-DNA, CA)
with a 250 bp region was amplified with the primer HLBr. The plasmid was
diluted 10-fold and used with the following dilutions: 1 $\times$
10^-2^, 1 $\times$ 10^-3^, 1 $\times$ 10^-4^, 1 $\times$ 10^-6^, 1
$\times$ 10^-7^, and 1 x 10^-8^ ng. Pathogen quantity was reported as
copy number of Lso, copy numbers were determined using the methods of
[Levy et al. -@Levy2011].

Each psyllid tested positive for Lso, suggesting a 100% rate of
infection for the colony.

No-Choice Behavior Assays {#sec:no-choice}
-------------------------

No-choice assays were conducted in a climate-controlled room maintained
at 26. Assays were conducted on a wire shelving unit which allowed the
testing arena to be lit both from above and below. Three Smith-Victor
Digilight fixtures (Smith-Victor Corporation, Bartlett, IL) were used
with three Azlo (Akces Media LLC dba ALZO Digital, Bethel, CT)
full-spectrum CFL bulbs per light fixture (100-240 volts, 60 Hz, color
temp 5500K CRI 91, 750 lumens, 15 watts). Two lights were placed with
their light sources 35 cm above the testing arena and the light was
softened with a diffusion material. The remaining light fixture was
placed so that its light source was 45 cm below the testing arena and
was softened with diffusion material as well. Illuminance was 3600 lx at
the surface of the arena (Sekonic L-308DC-U Light Meter, Sekonic
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

The observation arena (*Fig. 1*) was modeled after the design described by Liu
et al. [-@Liu2004], but modified to use leaflets of intact, potted
plants like Butler et al. [-@Butler2011]. This permitted us to observe
the psyllids with minimal interference to plant physiology and avoided
altering plant volatiles or chemical defenses activated by damaging
plant tissues [@Klingler2005]. A recording arena was formed by
sandwiching a panel of glass, a wetted filter paper, a leaf, and a piece
of Plastazote polyethylene foam (Zotefoams Inc., Croydon, UK), with a
circular opening in the center (28 mm diameter). The arena was held
together with two clips. This arena was then suspended by a suction cup
held by an adjustable burette clamp. We used leaves from the upper
canopy of the plants. The filter paper was discarded between
observations. The glass pane and foam were replaced with each new plant
and washed and dried at 90 before reuse to remove potential volatile
accumulation. Recordings were done with a L3CMOS C-mount USB camera and
ToupView recording software (L3CMOS14000KPA, Hangzhou ToupTek Photonics
Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China).

We collected psyllids from the colony by aspiration and transferred them
to 8 $\times$ 35 mm glass shell vials. All psyllids were used within 90
minutes from the time of collection. Psyllids were introduced to the
arena and recorded for five minutes. Psyllid sex was identified and
psyllids were preserved in 95% ethanol for later testing for Lso by PCR.
We recorded similar categories as Butler et al. [-@Butler2011]:
probing, walking, cleaning, and whether the psyllid was on or off the
leaf. Probing behaviors have putative significance with disease
transmission and host selection [@Prager2014a a;
-@Prager2014b b]. Behavior was scored using CowLog3 [@Haenninen2009],
which recorded incidence and timestamps for the behaviors observed.

Oviposition Assays {#sec:fecundity}
------------------

Oviposition assays were conducted with greenhouse conditions, plants,
and insects as previously described. A female/male pair of
teneral psyllids (identified by their green body color) was introduced
to a plant covered with an insect rearing sleeve (MegaView Science Co.,
Ltd., Taiwan). Rearing sleeves were supported over the plant using two
lengths of galvanized steel wire with a diameter of 1.63 mm. Each wire
was curved into a parabolic shape and each end of the wire was inserted
into the soil on opposite corners of the plant pot (*Fig. 2*). Plants were
blocked by germplasm accession in rows of four and placed inside 60 cm
length $\times$ 60 cm width $\times$ 60 cm height mesh-covered
PVC-framed cages. Plants were watered on alternating days by soaking
pots in 56 cm length $\times$ 28 cm width $\times$ 6 cm height plastic
trays until the soil became saturated (approximately 45 mins). After a
period of six to eight days the males were removed from the plants and
the female transferred to a new plant of the same accession. The female
psyllid was then transferred to a new plant every four days at three
intervals. Eggs were counted on each plant after the female was removed.
Nymphs were counted four days, eight days and twelve days later to allow
time for hatching [@Knowlton1931]. Each nymph was removed as it was
counted. The number of nymphs that hatched was considered an indicator
of egg fertility. Fertility percentages were calculated as the ratio of
nymphs divided by egg counts for each sample.

Statistical Analysis {#sec:stats}
--------------------

Statistical analysis was performed using R Version 3.5.1 [@RCT2013]
Assumptions of normality were investigated with qqplots and Cullen and
Frey graphs from the R package fitdistrplus [@Delignette-Muller2015].
No-choice experiments and egg count data were analyzed using generalized
linear mixed modeling techniques (GLMM) [@Stroup2015] from the glmer
function [@Bates2015]. A Poisson distribution and log link were used to
model count data. Egg fertility was modeled with a binomial distribution
and log link to account for ratios. Behavioral models had fixed factors
of germplasm accession, sex and the interaction of accession $\times$
sex. Psyllid replicate was treated as a random factor. The interaction
of accession $\times$ sex was excluded from the off-leaf model to low
occurrences (n = 20 out of 181 observations), which did not allow an
interaction to be estimated by the model. Oviposition models had fixed
factors of accession, period and accession $\times$ period. Psyllid
replicate was considered the random factor. Egg fertility was modeled
with accession and period as fixed factors and individual psyllids as
the random factor. All data were tested with Wald's $\chi$^2^ tests,
followed by least-squares means with Tukey's adjustments to test for
multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was considered at
$\alpha$ = 0.05.

Results {#ch:results}
=======

No-Choice Assays {#sec:results_no-choice}
----------------

The number of probing events observed was significantly different among
genotypes (*Table 1*). Psyllids probed more frequently on Russet Burbank than on
A07781-10LB and A07781-3LB, which did not differ between each other (*Table 2*).
Probing frequency on A07781-4LB did not differ among the other
genotypes. This effect appeared to reflect the trend of more probing by
females on Russet Burbank (*Table 2*). However, the genotype $\times$ sex
interaction was not significant (*Table 1*). Probing frequency did not was not
affected by sex (*Table 2*). Overall, psyllids spent more time engaged in probing
behavior than in the other activities recorded (*Tables 2-5*). Probing duration did not differ
among genotypes, between sexes or by their interaction (*Table 1*).

The number of walking events differed significantly among genotypes as
well as by the interaction of genotype $\times$ sex (*Table 1*). Psyllids walked
more on Russet Burbank than 10LB (*Table 3*). Female psyllids on Russet Burbank
walked significantly more often than males and females on 10LB and
females on 3LB (*Table 3*). The other means did not differ among each other.
Walking duration did not differ among genotypes or between sexes, but
the interaction term was significant (*Table 1*). Female psyllids walked
significantly longer on Russet Burbank than for all other genotype
$\times$ sex combinations (*Table 3*).

Cleaning behaviors generally were uncommon and of short duration. The
frequencies and durations of cleaning behaviors were not significantly
different among genotypes, between sexes, or by their interaction
(*Table 1*, *Table 4*).

Off-leaf behaviors also tended to occur rarely. Frequency of off-leaf
behaviors did not differ among genotypes, between sexes or by their
interaction (*Table 1*). However, the duration of off-leaf behaviors differed
significantly among genotypes (*Table 1*). Psyllids spent more time off-leaf in
the 3LB treatment relative to the 4LB and Russet Burbank treatments.
Time spent off-leaf in the 10LB treatment did not differ among the other
genotypes (*Table 5*). Off-leaf duration did not differ by sex (*Table 1*). The
interaction between genotype and sex could not be analyzed due to the
low number psyllids observed leaving the leaf (n = 20 out of 181).

Oviposition Assays {#sec:results_fecund}
------------------

Neither the number of eggs nor percent viable eggs differed
significantly among genotypes (*Table 6*). However, both the number of eggs
and egg fertility were significantly different by period and the
interaction of genotype $\times$ period (*Table 6*). For oviposition, this
interaction effect was an artifact of calculating multiple comparisons
of different genotypes across observation periods. There were no
significant differences among genotypes within a given period (*Table 7*). For
egg fertility during the last period, there were significantly more
fertile eggs on Russet Burbank than 10LB or 3LB and there were
significantly more eggs on 4LB than 10LB (*Table 7*). There were no significant
differences among genotypes within periods 1-3 (*Table 7*). Overall oviposition
(with genotype pooled) was significantly lower during period 4 than for
the first (*Table 7*). Similarly, egg fertility (with genotype pooled) tended to
decline during the last observation period for all genotypes except for
Russet Burbank (*Table 7*).

Discussion {#ch:discuss}
==========

It is difficult to separate the mechanisms of host plant resistance or
tolerance and how these correlate with psyllid host acceptance
[@Diaz-Montano2006; @Butler2011]. Our visual observations of settling behavior
lack the precision of electrical penetration recordings used in similar
studies [Butler et al. -@Butler2012b; @Mustafa2015b;
@Sandanayaka2014], but requires less expensive equipment.
Our results are like other investigations of putatively resistant potato
genotypes. Our study found more probing and walking on Russet Burbank
than on the putatively resistant genotypes, which is consistent with
results reported by Butler et al. [-@Butler2011] and Prager et al.
[-@Prager2014b; b]. However, in contrast to Butler et al.
[-@Butler2011], we found cleaning and leaf-leaving behaviors to be
rare. Russet Burbank received more probes than two other
genotypes, but the psyllids still probed the other genotypes, often for long
periods. Sandanayaka et al. [-@Sandanayaka2014] and Mustafa et al
[-@Mustafa2015b; b] both suggest that it takes *B. cockerelli*
approximately two hours to access the phloem and acquire Lso. This
suggests that very long recordings may be necessary to determine when
probing becomes true feeding. Minimal overnight recordings revealed
little activity besides apparent feeding on the genotype where they were
placed (ANF, unpublished data). In addition, psyllids rarely abandoned the plants where they began to probe.
A single psyllid is enough to transmit Lso and the disease progresses independently 
of bacterial titer [@Buchman2011a; a; @Rashed2012]. Therefore, it is unlikely that
we were observing phloem feeding which would result in pathogen
transmission within the span of our short observation periods. These
factors underscore that psyllid probing behavior would have to be nearly
eliminated to truly reduce the risk of Lso transmission. We found no
evidence for such reductions in probing behavior on these genotypes.

Studies on the Asian citrus psyllid, *Diaphorina citri* Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae),
a vector of a similar liberibacter pathogen [@Teixeira2005] have examined
how host plant volatiles can alter psyllid behaviors [@Davidson2014; @Wenninger2009].
Plant volatiles can induce probing in combination to visual and chemical cues from host plants [@Patt2011].

It is possible that Lso infection has altered *B. cockerelli*'s
attraction to leaf volatiles [@Mayer2008], and their settling behavior as well
[@Mas2014]. Lso infection can increase psyllid preferences for undamaged,
uninfected hosts for oviposition and settling [@Davis2012] -- a
behavior which has been seen in other insect-plant-vector relationships
[@Cao2016; @Eigenbrode2018]. It may be that this encouraged greater acceptance of genotypes which
would be rejected by an uninfected psyllid. A high percentage of the psyllids in our colony were infected
and our plants were all uninfected, so psyllid infection does not entirely explain the patterns we have seen.
Infection status also fails to explain the minor trend we saw between male and female probing on Russet Burbank.

Another explanation for differences between genotypes is that the female psyllids
are more influenced by familiar cues while selecting host plants for oviposition or feeding [Prager et al.
-@Prager2014a]. Russet Burbank was one of the plants used to rear our colonies, 
so it is possible that the volatiles from this variety were more stimulating for
female psyllids. Further studies into potato psyllid's attraction to plant volatiles while infected
can help clarify if these possible explanations correlate with host plant
acceptance.

Although leaf-leaving duration differed significantly among genotypes,
the incidence and duration of leaf-leaving behaviors was very small and
probably not biologically significant. It is also important to note that leaf-leaving
was defined in the context of leaving the leaf in our small observation arena.
On a plant in the field there is a much larger
surface area for a psyllid to explore, so the leaf-leaving events might
represent questing behavior rather than host rejection. It also is
possible that the duration between a psyllid's initial encounter and
settling behaviors or eventual plant rejection is longer than the time
we allotted for recording.

Contrary to previously published studies [@Butler2011;
@Cooper2014; @Diaz-Montano2013;
@Rubio-Covarrubias2017] our study showed similar oviposition rates
among genotypes, consistent with results reported by
[@Prager2017]. Other studies have found psyllids will oviposit on a
variety of hosts [@Diaz-Montano2013;
@Thinakaran2015], even when it is not beneficial for their survival
(@Prager2014b b). Psyllids oviposited on every type of
potato offered, like observations by Prager et al.
[-@Prager2017], giving little evidence of antixenosis.

We selected the number of days for our observations to correlate with
the periods of maximum oviposition reported in the life history tables
of Abdullah [-@Abdullah2008; @Knowlton1931] and Yang et al.
[-@Yang2010; -@Yang2013]. Therefore, it was surprising to see the
large reduction of egg fertility for some psyllids in period four (18-24
days). Fertility declined on the resistant genotypes as opposed to the
Russet Burbank variety, which suggests that these genotypes may have
antibiotic effects over time. Over the course of a growing season, these
reductions may have a cumulative effect on psyllid populations. Longer
observation periods could help to better quantify these effects.

It is possible that Lso infection status played a role in the fertility
observed: Lso has been reported to negatively impact female fertility
[@Frias2018; @Nachappa2012; -@Nachappa2012a a;
-@Nachappa2014; @Yao2016]. The antibiotic effects we observed may
have different effects on uninfected psyllids.

We saw a large degree of variability in fertility for psyllids on all
genotypes. We only permitted male access to the female psyllids during
the initial period to increase female longevity by preventing possible
harassment [@Abdullah2008; @Arnqvist2005; @Wenninger2008].
Abdullah [-@Abdullah2008; and Yang and Liu -@Yang2009; and Yang et
al. -@Yang2013] all kept female and male psyllids together to freely
mate for the duration their observations, which may explain why they
observed greater fertility than we did. It is possible that potato
psyllids may require multiple mates and/or multiple matings over time to
maintain egg fertility [@Arnqvist2005; @Wenninger2008]. Knowlton and
Janes [-@Knowlton1931] reported (with a limited number of
observations) reductions in egg fertility over time after a single
mating. There also may be some variability in female reproductive output
created by the physiological interactions of male spermatophores, female
spermathecae and/or spermatodose [@Marchini2011], which all
influence how long females are able to remain fertile [@Abe2015;
@Qazi2010; @Schnakenberg2011; @Wolfner2011].

In conclusion, we found little evidence of antixenosis or antibiosis
with respect to settling behavior, but we saw a reduction in egg
fertility on the resistant genotypes 18-24 days after mating. Taken
together, these results suggest that the modality of resistance to Lso
for the A07781 genotypes [@Rashidi2017] is not likely related to
psyllid settling behaviors, but that reduced Lso symptoms may be due to
resistance to the pathogen itself, and not the psyllid vector. Further
work will be required to clarify the modality of resistance to Lso in
the A07781 genotypes.

Table 7 Mean ($\pm$ SEM) egg totals and egg fertility of psyllids on four different genotypes. A mating pair of psyllids was placed on a caged plant for six to eight days after which the male was removed. The remaining female was transferred every four days to a new plant of the same genotype until 12 more days had elapsed.
